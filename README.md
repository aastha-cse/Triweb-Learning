## JavaScript Practice

In the `JavaScript` directory, I've practiced JavaScript concepts.Some of them include:
  
- `toggleText.html` and `toggleText.js`: A basic interactive webpage that allows you to toggle text and image and add text using prompt box.
- `date.js` and `digitalClock.js`: Practiced Date methods.
- `arrayMethods.js`: Practiced Array methods.
- `regex.js`: Practiced Regular Expressions and its methods.
- `iteratorGenerator.js`: Practiced iterator and generator functions.
- `promiseChaining.js`: Practiced promise chaining.

## Basic Projects
In the `Projects` directory, I've practiced JavaScript by creating interactive web elements and simple applications. The projects include:
  
- `BasicJSProject`: Involves interactive boxes that dynamically display entered text when moved to specific positions, demonstrating simple DOM manipulation and interactivity.
- `HTML-CSS-JS-Project`: Added validations to the form that I've created above.

## MySQL Practice
In the `MySQL` directory, I've explored MySQL and its usage in web development. Some of the examples include:
  
- `createTable.txt`: Creating and querying a sample database and tables.
- `CRUD.txt`: Demonstrating basic SQL operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- `joins.txt`: Demonstrating types of joins like INNER, LEFT, RIGHT.

## ES6 Practice
In the `ES6` directory, I've practiced commonly used features of ES6. Some of the examples include:
  
- `math.js`: Explored some new math methods.
- `spread.js`: Demonstrating the use of spread operator.
- `propertyShorthand.js`: Demonstrating shorthand syntax for objects.

## NodeJS Practice
In the `NodeJS` directory, I've practiced creating routes, handling requests, connecting to databases and performing CRUD operations. 
I've used Postman - a popular collaboration platform for API development that simplifies the process of building, testing, and documenting APIs. Some of the examples include:
  
- `calculator.js`: Demonstrating the methods to create routers and controllers and perform mathematical operations.
- `user.js`: Demonstrating the CRUD operations performed with the help of sequelize library.
